# To Do List

## Backend

### Planning
* Devise hash for determining isomorphism classes
* Labeling for subgroups
* Labeling for conjugacy classes
* Write more upload code

### Uploading data
* Add generator and relations template to families
* Add Magma coded number for families from series
* Add additional families to gps_families and gps_special_names
* Upload SmallGroup data except 512, 1024, 1536
* Very large sample examples


## Frontend

* Character tables visible or add conjugacy classes (and order statistics)
* Create subgroup lattice as graph
* Click vs. Mouseover of subgroups?
* Add list of orders of elements in the group to top
* Add special names (aliases) to *Construction* section
* Add permutation representations
* Make supergroups a searchable option
* Add special family presentations in those cases
* Change group characteristics list to be more like:  "cyclic (and so abelian, solvable, nilpotent, and monomial)"  instead of just full list
    * Z-group means metacyclic, supersolvable, and monomial
    * Cyclic hence abelian, solvable, nilpotent, and monomial
    * Abelian hence solvable, nilpotent, and monomial
    * Metabelian hence solvable
    * Metacyclic hence metabelian, supersolvable, and monomial
    * Monomial hence solvable 
    * Supersolvable hence monomial
* Create download buttons for Magma/GAP code
* Improve searches

## Knowls

* Series knowls
* Radical subgroup
* rename agroup and zgroup to a_group and z_group in code, same with rational versus rational_group
* Rename Meow Wolf to Tim
* RCS knowls
