We'll plan to meet at AIM, May 20-24.
We intend to support abstract groups, groups with a certain presentation (be it permutation, abelian, or other), faithful linear representation with coefficients in Fp, C, Z, or Z/NZ up to various kinds of conjugacy, finite subgroups of SO, GSp and other algebraic groups, subgroups of finite index in various infinite algebraic groups (SL2Z or PSL2Z being the most important example)
Focus on how do things integrate with the rest of the LMFDB: this is where we can add value.
Drew will invite Tim Dokchitser

Goals:
GL_n(C) (n=2, maybe 3)
GL_2(Fp) (p up to 1000)
GL_n(Z) (n up to 6)
Transitive groups (up to 47, but with bounds on the order that depend on the degree)
Intransitive permutation representations (unclear what the bounds are)
Finite index subgroups of PSL_2(Z)

Sources of inspiration:
* Tim Dokchitser's [GroupNames](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/)
* Sebastian Pauli's [Congruence Subgroups](https://mathstats.uncg.edu/sites/pauli/congruence/)
* Atlas of simple groups (the book).  We probably won't be able to support all of the conjugacy class names since some of them are hand-coded.
