/*
This file contains prototype code for deterministically labeling conjugacy classes of subgroups of a finite group G.
In the discussion below when we refer to a subgroup H of G we always view it as representating its conjugacy class;
we only care about subgroups of G up to G-conjugacy.

There are currently 4 strategies under consideration.

(1) Label subgroups as we find them (the 17th subgroup we find gets label 17).

    PROs: Labels are short and easy to assign, we don't need to know all the subgroups of G to assign labels.
    CONs: Labels have no mathematical meaning.
      Labels cannot be reconstructed, we have to store explicit generators for each subgroup forever.

(2) Label subgroups H using the permutation representation pi_H:G -> S_n given by the action of G on cosets of H
    (so n=[G:H]) and we number cosets 1,...,n).  The S_n-conjugacy class of pi_H(G) uniquely determines the
    G-conjugacy class of H.
    The map pi_H is computed by the Magma function CosetAction (which uses the right G-action on right cosets).

    To identify the S_n-conjugacy class of pi(G) we fix generators g1,...,gr for G and take the minimal rep
    of the Sn-orbit of the sequence s_H := (pi_H(g1),...,pi_H(gn)) where we write each element of S_n as a
    a sequence of cycles in decreasing order of length with each cycle represented by a tuple of integers in [1..n],
    with first element minimal and cycles of the same length ordered lexicographically.  With this representation
    cycles of length 1 can be omitted without changing the order (so we omit them).

    Thus s_H is a list of lists of disjoint lists of integers in [1..n] of length at least 2.  The set of all such
    objects is an S_n-set, and we take the lexicographically minimal element of the S_n-orbit of s_H as a canonical
    representative of the S_n-conjugacy class of pi_H(G), and of the G-conjugacy class of H.

    The function sig(G,H) below computes this "signature" of the subgroup H.

    PROs: The label sig(G,H) is an intrinsic invariant of H that depends only on fixing a list of generators for G.
          The label sig(G,H) can be computed directly from H without enumerating subgroups or conjugacy classes of G.
    CONs: Labels are long (but if we are prepared to compute all of them we can sort them and use ordinals instead).
          Labels are hard to compute, infeasibly so if n=[G:H] is at all large.  The code in this file can handle n
          up to perhaps 14 or 15, and an optimized implementation could surely go much further, but without a
          polynomial-time (or even subexponential-time) algorithm this is never going to be practical for most of
          the groups we care about.

Neither (1) nor (2) is particularly attractive.  The remaining options under consideration all involve labels n.i.j,
where n=[G:H] is the index, i is an ordinal that distinguishes Gassmann equivalence classes of the same index, and j is
an ordinal that distinguishes Gassmann-equivalent conjugacy classes of subgroups.  Recall that subgroups H1 and H2 of G
are Gassmann equivalent if they intersect each G-conjugacy class with the same cardinality, equivalently, H1 and H2 have
the same index n and the permutation representations pi_H1:G->S_n and pi_H2:G->S_n have the same character (which counts
the number of cosets fixed by each conjugacy class). An equivalent condition is that the G-sets [G\H1] and [G\H2] are
isomorphic as Q[G]-modules (so think of Gassmann classes as isogeny classes).

In order to label Gassmann classes we need to fix an ordering of the conjugacy classes of elements of G (doing this in
a canonical or at least "sensible" way is a separate problem that we assume has been solved before we start labelling
subgroups).  Having fixed such an ordering it is easy to compute a unique identifier for each Gassmann class; one can use
the PermutationCharacter function in Magma (which uses whatever ordering Magma chooses for conjugacy classes), or one can
count the intersection of H with each G-conjugacy class (to do this efficiently one enumerates conjugacy classes of
elements of H (in any order) and uses an efficiently computable map from elements of G to conjugacy class identifiers
(e.g. as returned by the ClassMap function in Magma). The latter approach is used by the function SubgroupClass below.
(using PermutationCharacter takes about the same time, both are very fast).

In order to keep labels small we assume that we compute all the Gassmann classes for a given index so we can assign
ordinals to them (but we don't have to do this for all subgroups, just all with the same index).

  (3) Label subgroups n.i.j by ordering the Gassmann classes of index n lexicographically using either the
      permutation character or the sequence of conjugacy class counts computed by the function SubgroupClass below
      (note these orderings are different, we need to choose one).  This determines i, and to compute j we order
      Gassmann equivalent subgroups by the signature sig(G,H) described in (2).  Most Gassmann classes are singletons,
      in which case we set j=1 and do not need to compute sig(G,H).  This approach is implemented by the function
      LabelSubgroupsSlow below.

   PROs: Well defined mathematically meaningful labels that can be computed somehwat efficiently.
         We don't need to label all subgroups, but we do need to label all with the same index.
   CONs: Too slow to be practical in groups with non-trivial Gassmann classes of large index.

    (4) Label subgroups n.i.j computing n and i as above, but to compute j we first order subgroups H in the same
        Gassmann class using the lex ordering on sorted list of labels of all (proper) supergroups of H (one can
        and often does have Gassmann equivalent subgroups for which the lists of supergroups are differ).  Note that
        here "supergroup" refers to inclusions in the poset of conjugacy classes of subgroups: we consider K to be
        a supergroup of H if it contains any G-conjugate of H (note that we are free to fix any G-conjugate of K
        provided we check all the G-conjugates of H for inclusion).  Only in cases where two or more Gassmann
        equivalent subgroups have the same set of supergroups do we resort to computing permutation rep signatures,
        and rather than computing sig(G,H), we are free to replace G with any supergroup K of H and instead compute
        sig(K,H), which helps a lot when [K:H] is smaller then [G:H].  We need to be careful to account for the fact
        that there may be two or more G-conjugates of H contained in K that are not K-conjugate, so we compute the
        sorted list sig(K,H') where H' varies over G-conjugates of H in K to esure we get a signature that is
        G-invariant (but computing a bunch of signatures of smaller index is much better than computing one of large
        index, and we are free to choose K to minimize the index, since we know that all the subgroups we want to
        distinguish have the same set of supergroups).

    This approach is implemented by the function LabelSubgroups below.

    PROs: Well defined mathematically meaningful labels that can be computed somehwat efficiently.
          We don't need to label all subgroups, but we do need to label all with index >= m for some m.
    CONs: There are still screw cases where this is hopelessly slow (e.g. PSL(2,29)), but it should be fast
          enough to feasible label all the subgroups of any groups in the small groups database, and lots of
          subgroups of transitive groups (at least up to a reasonable index bound).

The functions test_small, test_transitive, test_gl2p, and test_psl2q at the bottom of this file can be used to test the
functions LabelSubgroups and LabelSubgroupsSlow.  Each takes a bound m that restricts the groups under consideration
(e.g. size of the small group, degree of a transitive group, p for GL(2,p) and q for PSL(2,q), a function that must be
one of LabelSubgroups or LabelSubgroupsSlow, and an optional parameter max_index which if nonzero bounds the index of the
subgroups to be labelled.The test_transitive function also lets you restrict the size of the transitive group.  By default
the functions just tell you the number of subgroups labelled and the time it took, but set the optional parameter quiet
to false to see the labels.

It takes a few hours for test_small(255,LabelSubgroups) to run, which labels all 1077608 subgroups of the 7012 groups of
order up to 255.
