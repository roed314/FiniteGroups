Try to find minimal permutation rep (have a lot of this data).  This is likely the best to compute with.
Run IrreducibleModules(G, K) for K=Q and for K a small finite fields.  Save this!  Derive character table and rational character table (and rational).  Use MaxDegree parameter (char 0) or DimLim (char p)
Complex characters, resulting quantities (monomial, faithful reps)
Find automorphism group and save it (make sure to use existing computations)
Try to find the holomorph, and the consequences up to autjugacy (probably only feasible for somewhat small groups)
Find normal subgroups (and resulting quantities, like direct product factorization).  This probably involves rewriting the NormalSubgroups intrinsic to not call Subgroups.
Find all subgroups (and resulting quantities, like semidirect products, rank, eulerian function, better group names)

Generate a list of subs/quos for hashing and identification (don't add them, but it would be good to know if they're already there)
Other stuff (schur_multiplier, wreath_data)

Path to finishing computations:
1. Finish creating the to_add file that will be fed into google cloud.
 a. List of groups is finalized
 b. PCreps are done enough: optimized reps for 257,936+51,565 groups, fast reps for 203,654 groups; 31,647 nonsolvable
 c. Minreps are done enough: minimal degree permutation rep for 532,960 groups; 11,842 missing (of which 11,444 have a smallish permutation representation)
 d. Matreps are in progress: nxn matrix groups over Fq found for n=2 and q<1000, n=3 and q<15, n=4 and q < 6, n=5 and q=2, 2x2 matrix groups over Z/N from Drew are identified except for Z/72, have code for optimizing generators.
 e. Have been using StringToGroup and GroupToString; recently created StringToGroupHom and GroupHomToString for GL(n,q) -> PGL(n,q), Sp -> PSp, SL -> PSL, SO -> PSO, etc and matrix groups over Z/N
 f. Need to pick heuristics for which representation to choose in displaying elements.  Plan: use pc for abelian and 2-generator, then compare (pc ngens) ~ (perm deg)^(3/5) ~ (mat deg).  Note that this heuristic doesn't include matrix base ring (add one?)
2. Modify code to run in cloud
 a. Have created cloud_prep.py, which makes a tarball with everything needed for a run
 b. Then cloud_start.py just takes an integer and uses a manifest file to translate that to a particular magma script.  We've already used this to compute some minreps and pcreps.  For main computation, have split up the tasks into parts which can be run independently (first we'll do a run with a shortish timeout that goes through these tasks sequentially, then another where they're split up, then a final one falling back to normal subgroups if all subgroups was infeasible)
 c. Need to use Complements to find semidirect decompositions from NormalSubgroups
 d. Use 

Have label return isomorphism and use it!

Fix {""} and new mon.tmpheader in lists of text (5-minute timeout run)

Use semidirect products to select a better name and fix latex errors (postprocess step so that we can work up from the bottom and include Lie group names if not stupid); make sure to modify other places names show up (subgroups table); make sure status variables like complex_characters_known are accurate (might have tried and failed)

For discussion:
 * ngens (not very mathematically meaningful)
